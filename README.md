The current method for solidifying NH3 at the UNH NPG flash freazes the NH3. This leaves the NH3 prone to gas pockets in the solid and getting less NH3 per NH3 bead. Phase I is to design and build a cooling apparatus that can slow freeze the NH3 to eliminate the gas pockets created from flash freazing. Phase II is to quantify how the NH3 made by slow freazing is different from that made by flash freazing. To accomplish this a density measurement device will be made. Since the NH3 must be kept below its freezing temperature (-77 C) Archamedes principal will be used with LN2 (Liquid at -195 C). Phase III
