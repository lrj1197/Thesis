  The current method for solidifying NH3 at the UNH NPG flash freazes the NH3. This leaves the NH3 prone to gas pockets in the solid and getting less NH3 per NH3 bead. Phase I is to design and build a cooling apparatus that can slow freeze the NH3 to eliminate the gas pockets created from flash freazing. Phase II is to quantify how the NH3 made by slow freazing is different from that made by flash freazing. To accomplish this a density measurement device will be made. Since the NH3 must be kept below its freezing temperature (-77 C) Archamedes principal will be used with LN2 (Liquid at -195 C). Phase III will be to determine the life time of the slow-made NH3 in a high energy electron beam. Main question is if the slow-made NH3 lasts longer, how much longer does the sample last? 
  The main notes,CAD files, programs, and photos gathered are presented in this repository. The Notes folder has a daily log of what was done and the useful facts gathered durring that day. The files are titled based on the date in which they were taken. The CAD files show the drawings and engineering schematics for the instuments built. They are labeled by the name of what is in the file and the prototype number, e.g Coldfinger_1_2 is the drawing for the coldfinger and it is the second prototype. The Codes folder has all the programs and snipets used for this project.
