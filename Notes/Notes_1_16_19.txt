Coldfinger 1.2 test:
	Modifications from 1.1:
		-> thermoetry is at the top exterior of the cryostat
		-> the 4L dewar was used to house the LN2
		-> mounting plate is 2x larger 
		-> 4x coldfingers
	Observations:
		-> start time: 10:45 am 
		-> inital resistance 128.99 Ohms
		-> dRdt = ~0.1 ohms/ min
		-> looking for roughly 136 Ohms => -87 C 
		-> measureing device would be really useful
		-> bottom will be the coldest, measure temperature from bottom of cryostat shaft
		-> min 45 R = 130.2 ~ -39 C 
		-> min 60 R = 130.3 ~40 C
		-> CF fully sumberged in LN2 at 11:45 R = 130.8
		-> min 90 R = 130.9 => -45 ish 
		-> almost at R = 131 
		-> hr 1 min 15 R = 131.34 => -49 C 
		-> frost forming on the exterior shell of the cryostat... very cold. 
		-> hr 1 min 30 R = 131.47 => -51 C 
	Over all the colfinger design passed. I was able to get the top of the cryostat to around -50 C given that the top outside of the cryostat was at that temperature, it can be assumed that the bottom inside of the cryostat is around -80 C. 

Redesign 1.3:
	-> use copper
	-> reduce to single 1x1x3in coldfinger 
	-> use thermometry on the extirior shell
	-> model the inside temperature based on the outside temperature
	-> use 4L dewar
	-> make a better lid
	-> get a method for determining the LN2 levels inside the dewar.
