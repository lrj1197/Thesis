Coldfinger 1.3:
    -> the copper seems to work well
        -> saw rapid change in temp at min 18
            -> possible cause is faulty thermometry
    -> need better thermometry
        -> using thermocouple and arduino
            -> need way to modulate thermocouple
            -> write code for arduino
        -> calibrate thermocouple for range [0,-100] C
    -> need working levelmeter for LN2

Density Measurement:
    -> need small stryofoam cup and with lid ~ 1/4 L
    -> need accurate levelmeter
