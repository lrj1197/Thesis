LN2 levelmeter prototype 1.0:
	-> used foam block and small metal rod to measure the level of the LN2 in a dewar.
	-> the foam block was able to sustain stable floating but the probe wanders around the bath
	-> construction of jig to hold meter to linear verticle motion is required before the probe can be inplemented.

Coldfinger prototype 1.3:
	-> parts requested. 
	-> looking in mech shop, Cu plate is there, need rod.
