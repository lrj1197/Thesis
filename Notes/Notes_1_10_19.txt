LN2 evap rate: -0.045 mL/s
rho_LN2: 0.807 g/mL
LN2 mass loss: -0.04 +/- 0.01 g/s

thoughts:
	-> preform density measurements with full holy bottles?
		-> could work, need bottles to be in LN2 before going in 
	-> cool down body first before 
	-> use small ruler and bobber to measure the height of LN2 in container
	fasten to side of container to ensure linear motion.
		Materials:
			-> small bobber (walmart)
			-> small ruler (Staples) pocket ruler 6 in wood? plastic? not metal tho.
				-> loosely staple to side of cup

determine the rate at which LN2 evaporates when in contact with room temp body.
LN2 rate of evaporation = -.25 mL/s
LN2 rate of evaporation = -0.20 g/s
