Plan:
	Phase 1 (Cooling apparatus):
		-> build the cooling helix
			-> 2 parallel 1/8" copper tubing, 6 coils spanning 8" long and 2.75" wide. 
			-> ~10.5' of copper tubing.
		-> install the thermometry
			-> Ryan is sending the materials for the thermometry device. 
				-> Monday @ 9am
			-> Firmware is on Box
		-> get method for LN2/N2 delivery 
		-> test in methanol
		-> run gas panel with CO2 and test cooling helix 
		-> run gas panel with NH3
	Phase 2 (Density measurement):
		-> build apparatus to measure the density
		-> test on CO2
		-> test on NH3_LN2 and NH3_M
	(If densities are different)
		Phase 3 (DNP of NH3_M and NH3_LN2):
			-> DNP NH3_M and test life under radiation beam
			-> should last longer since higher density
		Phase 4 (EGS4 Simulation):
			-> run the simulation with different densities
			-> see if life time of slug is extended due to higher density
Questions:
	1) how to deliver and control the flow of LN2 and N2 gas into cooling helix?
		-> ideas:
			-> pressurized LN2/N2 take with line to cooling helix (Ellie mentioned this)
				needs relief valve and needs only ~5psi 
				use valves to maintain pressure in the chamber and which is flowing.
				if failures occur could result in pressure bomb
				more efficient
				better control?
			-> pump pulling LN2/N2 from reservoir
				used this before but requires separate pump to run simultaneously with gas panel
				just need a t split with two valves to determine which is flowing.
				safer
				less efficient
				don't want to pull LN2 into pump... very bad.
	2) CAD of cooling helix 
		-> model 1.0 complete
		-> avoid kinks and sharp bends?  
			-> as of now, assume no
	3) How to get cold N2? 
		-> phase separator? 
		-> seal the reservoir and pull the gas from the top. 
	4) attach thermocouples to system 
		-> attach on opposite side of the excess line and place in between the coils 
		-> goal is to measure the temp of the bath around where the cryostat is.
	5) efficient dewar? 
		-> thinking small Styrofoam box with lid where lid has the cooling helix attached
		-> build a lid for existing 1L dewar 
	6) how many coils to minimize time cooling? 
		-> thinking 6 or 9 shall suffice
	7) how to measure the temperature with thermocouples
		->RESCOLVED
		-> Ryan and Aruduino 
	8) Is it stable? how long to the methanol stay cold?
		->theroetical results say ~6 hrs
		-> RESOLVED
	9) Avoid kinks and tight bends to prevent blockage?
		-> if yes
			how to deliver to excess reservoir?
	10) is 1/8" large enough?
	11) prevent methanol from solidfiying on the coils
		-> using 75:25 MeOH:H2O will give a FP of around -77 C which is the FP of NH3
		-> using different ratios can acheive lower temps
			-> the ratio 86:14 yeilds a stable temperature of around -130 C (143 K), far below the FP of NH3
