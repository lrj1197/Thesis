Coldfinger redesign: Coldfinger_1_4.sat
    -> larger mounting plate
        -> Larger area => more heat transfer
    -> Thicker coldfinger (More coldfingers seperated by few mm gap)
        -> more material for LN2 to be in contact with
    -> Add two more holes to add set screws
    -> Remove block for push screw to go
    -> need way to fasten coldfingers to mounting block. -> Coldfinger_1_6.sat
    	RESOLVED
    	-> holes and oversized screw pounded in to hold
    		-> using 8-32 3/4 in flathead screws
    			-> use #29 drill bit and bore out hole
    			-> use 8-32 tap to make threads in hole
    			-> fasten to plate using screws
