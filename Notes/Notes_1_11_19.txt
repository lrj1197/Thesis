Assembled prototype cold finger
	-> two aluminium square rods fastened together using tube fastener epoxied to a mounting plate
	with two half holes on the end to be mounted to bottom of cryostat using set screws for end cap

Explore how the aluminum cold finger works at conducting thermal energy from the cryostat to the LN2 bath
c_Al = 205.0 # W/(m K)
c_Cu = 385.0 # W/(m K)
at 25 min with finger 1/2 sumbered, R = 130 (~ 62 C) and decresing, need better seal on top, key cryostat fully inside cold chamber. 
Holding steady at 103.52 Ohms (~ -62 C) for 3 - 6 min. 
@38 min T = -67 C  and rising 1 C every 2 min ish 
@43 min T = -66 C and droping at rate of 1 C every 4 min ish 
Temps are measured from middle height on cryostat, Temp is lower closer to the bottom. 

model of heat transfer along coldfinger to shell, how does heat spread along shell? Look for region where T < -77 C

dQdt = -2*pi*r*l*grad(T)
l = [0,12] #cm
r = [2,2.5] #cm
a = [0, 2*pi] #rads
Ti = -196 C 
T -> to be determined based on location on shell
F = cross sectional Area #cm^2

dQdt = -kA/dx * (Ti - T)
let 
grad(T) = dTdr + dTdl + (1/r)*dTda

assume
T = R(r)*L(l)*A(a)

then 
grad(T) = LA*dRdr + RA*dLdl + RL/r * dAda

do 
grad(T)/RLA = dRdr/R + dLdl/L + 1/(r*A)*dAda 

now  
(Ti/R*L*A - 1)*k*F/(2*pi*r*l*dx) =  dRdr/R + dLdl/L + 1/(r*A)*dAda

Need PDE sover now, Looks coupled
