Coldfinger 1.2 test 2:
	-> need to repeat test b/c test 1 had thermometry on top of the cryostat.
	-> test 2 will have thermometry on the bottom of the cryostat.
	Observations:
		-> start time 9:15
		-> @ 5 min temp is ~ -33 C
		-> @15 min temp is ~ -42 C
		-> @25 min temp is ~ -55 C
		-> @30 min temo is ~ -63 C
		-> added more LN2 st the level is covering half the coldfinger
		-> Temp went to ~ -68 C
		-> @ 45 min temp is ~ -75
		-> @ 53 min (10:05) temp is ~ -80

		-> rasiing the coldfinger to stabilize
		-> want to hold around 135 ohms for time
		-> temp flux of 2 C 
		-> @10:20 temp is ~ -80 
		-> @10:30 temp is ~ -80
		-> @1045 temp is ~ -80
	Results/Dsicussion:
		-> test 2 is a sucess.
		-> the coldfinger was able to get the bottom of the cyrostat down to -80 after about 50 minutes 
		-> The temperatrue was stable after the coldfinger was raised so that less of the coldfinger was in the LN2
		-> saw temperatrue flux of 3 C
