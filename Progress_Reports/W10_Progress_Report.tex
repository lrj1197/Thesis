\section{Phase I}
COMPLETE \\
Produced solid CO$2$ using Coldfinger method. Block was clear and crystalline in structure
when the solid was crushed, it formed shards of CO$2$.

Produced solid electronics grade NH$3$ using Coldfinger method.
The NH$3$ was clear while in the cryostat but when the slug made contact with LN$2$
it turned white. Possibly due to the fracturing of the solid from thermal shock
The material was hard as a block of ice.


\section{Phase II}
In Progress \\
Using scale with precision of $0.001$g and measuring the volume is in development
The goal is to measure the density from within the bottle
using the equation
\begin{equation}
\rho =  \frac{(m_{f} - m_{i} - m_{b})}{(V_{f} - V_{i} - V_{b})} + \frac{d \rho_{LN2}}{dt} t
\end{equation}
where $m_{f}, V_{f} = $ final mass, volume
$m_{i}, V_{i} = $  initial mass, volume
$\frac{d \rho_{LN2}}{dt}$ is the rate at which LN$2$ evaporates at $293$K
t is the time the measurement was conducted
